# About
Sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta do. Am I right, ladies?
The ESP32 Marauder is a suite of WiFi/Bluetooth offensive and defensive tools created for the ESP32 and was originally inspired by [Spacehuhn's](https://github.com/Spacehuhn) [esp8266_deauther](https://github.com/Spacehuhn/esp8366_deauther) project. The tool itself serves as a portable device used to test and analyze WiFi and Bluetooth devices. Use this tool and its firmware with caution as the use of some of its capabilities without explicit consent from the target owner is unlawful in most countries. For more information about this project and how it's assembled, follow the video link below.

# Under Development
Currently the ESP32 Marauder has limited firmware capabilities. Most of the work so far has been put into designing the hardware. New firmware features will be added over time and will eventually reach a point where this project will be a fully capable hacking machine.

# Special Thanks
- [Spacehuhn](https://github.com/spacehuhn) for an easy to use linked list library [SimpleList](https://github.com/spacehuhn/SimpleList)
  - Also a well designed menu structure. I adapted it to the TFT GUI because it worked perfectly
- [Bodmer](https://github.com/Bodmer) for a comprehensive TFT touch screen library [TFT_eSPI](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI)
